## The Registry

- It is the repository
for both systemwide and per-user settings --> plays a key role in the configuration and control of Windows systems

### Viewing and changing the registry

- `Regedit.exe` : main GUI tool for editing the registry.
- `Reg.exe` : has the ability to import, export, back up, and restore keys, as well as to compare, modify, and delete keys and values. It can also set or query flags used in UAC virtualization
- `Regini.exe` : allows you to import registry data based on text files that contain ASCII or Unicode configuration data.
- `Offreg.dll` (from WDK): Host the Offline Registry Library, this library allows loading registry key hive file in their binary format and applying operations on the files themselves, bypassing the usual logical loading and mapping that Windows requires for registry operations
