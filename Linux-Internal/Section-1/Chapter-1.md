# Chapter 1: Running Linux in a Virtual Environment

- Linux was designed from the ground up as a multiuser operating system
- Linux offers a better separation between administrative users and unprivileged 
- Linux is much more resistant to viruses and malware infections than Windows is
- Linux is a free and open-source software

## Looking at the threat landscape

Several cases where attackers have planted other types of malware on Linux servers
- `Botnet malware` used for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against other networks
- `Ransomware` encrypts user data until the server owner pays a ransom fee
- `Cryptocoin mining software` causes the CPUs of the server on which it's
planted to work extra hard and consume more energy

## Why do security breaches happen?

- Could be *security bugs* in the operating system or *security bugs* in an application that's running on that operating system
- *Out-of-the-box configuration* of a Linux server is quite insecure and can cause a whole ton of problems
- *Internet of Things (IoT)* has been many security problems with these devices, in large part because people just don't know how to configure them securely

## Keeping up with security news

Keep up with the latest security news in the IT business, somethings can be done:
- There are quite a few websites that specialize in network security news (Packet Storm Security, The Hacker News, Ars Technica, Fudzilla, The Register, ZDNet, and LXer, etc.)
- Keep up with the news and current documentation for your Linux distribution
